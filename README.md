# üó£Ô∏è Voice-to-Voice Chatbot

This project is a voice-to-voice chatbot that leverages speech recognition, AI-driven responses, and text-to-speech conversion to create an interactive conversation experience. The chatbot listens to your voice, processes the input using the LLaMA model, and speaks back the response in real-time.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Captures voice input using the Google Web Speech API.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Generates responses with the LLaMA model.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Converts AI responses to spoken words for a natural conversation flow.
- **Interactive Commands**: Type or say "skip" to exit the conversation at any time.
